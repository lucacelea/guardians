# Storefront

This is a sample storefront project. Even though you don't necessarily need to run this locally, this readme will tell you how.

## Install NodeJS

Install the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version in the 18.x branch.

## Install Angular dependencies

Now follow this [guide]( https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli) to setup the Angular CLI.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
